## Learnt how to use github pages and markdown to make websites.

Anyone who wants to learn how to do this can see my [repo](https://github.com/tapish2000/blog-all). It is as simple as you can think of. 
1. Create a repo of your desired name
2. Go to Settings > Options > Github Pages and enable that.
3. Choose some root, I read [here](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/608#issuecomment-109799721) later that it's better to choose docs/README.md but I chose the root one.
4. Select a theme if you want.
5. A `_config.yml` will be created. I have added some plugins and all in my `_config.yml` file which helps in creating links between pages although I don't need that for now.
6. Whatever you write in your README.md converts into HTML in you selected theme. I didn't want my posts markdown file to be called README.md so I changed it to `index.md` as index is also a default name for the homepage on github pages.
