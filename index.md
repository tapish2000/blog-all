## Started learning Django a few days ago
> 03-04-2021 19:30

Found a good playlist to start learning Django from basics 🚀. Although you should know a little bit of python 🤔.  
For those who may not know, **Django** is used to make websites ✨. I think it is really *good* and *fast to make a simple website* which I am working on in a course project 😅. It has *everything from database to UI* in it 😃.   
Here's the playlist: 👉 [Python Django Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p "Python Django Tutorial") 👈

## Learnt how to use github pages and markdown to make websites.
> 03-04-2021 14:37  

Anyone who wants to learn how to do this can see my [repo](https://github.com/tapish2000/blog-all) 😏. It is as simple as you can think of 🆒. 
1. Create a repo of your desired name 😃.
2. Go to 👉 Settings > Options > Github Pages and enable that.
3. Choose some root, I read [here](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/608#issuecomment-109799721) later 😅 that it's better to choose docs/README.md but I chose the root one.
4. Select a theme if you want ✨.
5. A `_config.yml` will be created. I have added some plugins and all in my `_config.yml` file which helps in creating links between pages although I don't need that for now.
6. Whatever you write in your README.md converts into HTML in your selected theme 🚀. I didn't want my posts' markdown file to be called README.md so I changed it to `index.md` as index is also a default name for the homepage on github pages.
